# Dynamic Interval Scheduling on a Single Machine
This repository includes all the source codes and reports related to my research project on dynamic interval scheduling and related problems under my advisor [Prof. Manoj Gupta](http://people.iitgn.ac.in/~gmanoj/). Initially, our motivation was to solve the fully dynamic version of this problem in better than $\mathcal{O}(n^{\frac{1}{3}})$ time per update. Although we could not solve that problem, we came up with a batch update algorithm which could be extended to the dynamic setting in $\mathcal{O}(n^{\frac{1}{2}})$ time per update.
